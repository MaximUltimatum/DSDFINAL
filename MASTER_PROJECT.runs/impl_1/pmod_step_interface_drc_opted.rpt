2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_button0/dirT_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    control/LEDz_reg[1] {FDSE}
    control/dirT_reg {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_button1/enT_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    control/LEDz_reg[0] {FDSE}
    control/enT_reg {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_button2/dirT_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    second_control/LED2z_reg[1] {FDSE}
    second_control/dirT_reg {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_button3/enT_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    second_control/LED2z_reg[0] {FDSE}
    second_control/enT_reg {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>
