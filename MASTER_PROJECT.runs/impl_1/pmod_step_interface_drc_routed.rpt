2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debounce_button0/rf_bounced_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debounce_button0/dirT_i_2/O, cell debounce_button0/dirT_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debounce_button1/rf_bounced_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debounce_button1/enT_i_2/O, cell debounce_button1/enT_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debounce_button2/rf_bounced_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debounce_button2/dirT_i_2__0/O, cell debounce_button2/dirT_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net debounce_button3/rf_bounced_3 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin debounce_button3/enT_i_2__0/O, cell debounce_button3/enT_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_button0/dirT_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    control/LEDz_reg[1] {FDSE}
    control/dirT_reg {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_button1/enT_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    control/LEDz_reg[0] {FDSE}
    control/enT_reg {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_button2/dirT_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    second_control/LED2z_reg[1] {FDSE}
    second_control/dirT_reg {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#4 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT debounce_button3/enT_i_2__0 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    second_control/LED2z_reg[0] {FDSE}
    second_control/enT_reg {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>
